This calendar was created using React. It renders the dates dynamically depending on the month and year selected from the dropdown. Clicking on a cell will create an event for that date and click will untoggle the event that is held in the Cell's state. 

There are still quite some todo's left that I could not get to because of time but can implement in the future:

• event editing
• time slots for events
• drag and drop

Make sure that you have the latest version of node installed on your machine , use 
`git clone https://github.com/phnx311/prompt-calendar.git`
then in the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

this will create a node modules folder and install needed depenencies

To view the calendar and test functionality run

### `npm start`
Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
